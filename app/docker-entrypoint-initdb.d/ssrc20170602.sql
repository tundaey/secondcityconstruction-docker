A large percentage of small business owners simply do not even know\r\nthat this change has taken place, and are left wondering why their search\r\nengine rankings have suddenly dropped. Also, it is increasingly common for\r\nphysical traffic to small businesses, such as restaurants, to be due to\r\ncustomers discovering them through a last-minute search on their phone.

When developing a mobile site, there are a few\r\nsimple methods for ensuring that your results measure up. Choose the option\r\nthat works best for you.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 1: Responsive Design</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website featuring responsive design is a\r\npopular choice nowadays. With responsive design, your site content is\r\nessentially the same for the mobile and desktop version (same HTML). Depending\r\non the device that is being used, the layout will be tailored so that it is\r\ncomfortable to read and straightforward to navigate. Screen size and\r\norientation are both accounted for and your display will shrink or expand\r\naccordingly. With this option, all of the changes take place behind the scenes,\r\nand the user will always navigate to the same URL regardless of whether they\r\nare using a desktop computer, a smartphone or a tablet. Google prefers a\r\nwebsite with responsive design.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 2: Separate Mobile Website</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever visited a website on your phone\r\nbefore and noticed an automatic redirect to a URL with \" /mobile\", or\r\nsomething similar, following the web address? The businesses whose websites\r\ndisplay in this manner from a mobile-device have built a separate website\r\nspecifically for mobile users. When web browsing on-the-go was first gaining\r\npopularity, a separate mobile website is how most businesses handled the issue.\r\nNow, this method is considered to be one of the least efficient approaches, as\r\nit requires unnecessarily keeping up with and maintaining two separate sites.\r\nThe success of this particular method relies on the proper recognition of the\r\ndevice being used, and since new, cutting-edge yet unfamiliar technology is\r\nconstantly being released, redirects and errors are commonplace.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 3: Dynamic Serving</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With dynamic serving, the server will\r\nreconstruct the HTML code based on the type of device it determines is seeking\r\nto gain access to your site. As with Responsive Design, you will be able to use\r\nthe same URL as the desktop version of your site. Unlike Responsive Design,\r\nyour website content will not be a miniature version of the desktop site - it\r\nwill have it\'s own unique content that is specifically catered to a mobile\r\nuser.</p>\r\n<p>There are pros and cons to each of these\r\noptions, and it is essential to weigh the individual needs of your business\r\nbefore making a decision. If taking care of any of these changes yourself feels\r\noverwhelming, you are not alone.

When developing a mobile site, there are a few\r\nsimple methods for ensuring that your results measure up. Choose the option\r\nthat works best for you.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 1: Responsive Design</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website featuring responsive design is a\r\npopular choice nowadays. With responsive design, your site content is\r\nessentially the same for the mobile and desktop version (same HTML). Depending\r\non the device that is being used, the layout will be tailored so that it is\r\ncomfortable to read and straightforward to navigate. Screen size and\r\norientation are both accounted for and your display will shrink or expand\r\naccordingly. With this option, all of the changes take place behind the scenes,\r\nand the user will always navigate to the same URL regardless of whether they\r\nare using a desktop computer, a smartphone or a tablet. Google prefers a\r\nwebsite with responsive design.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 2: Separate Mobile Website</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever visited a website on your phone\r\nbefore and noticed an automatic redirect to a URL with \" /mobile\", or\r\nsomething similar, following the web address? The businesses whose websites\r\ndisplay in this manner from a mobile-device have built a separate website\r\nspecifically for mobile users. When web browsing on-the-go was first gaining\r\npopularity, a separate mobile website is how most businesses handled the issue.\r\nNow, this method is considered to be one of the least efficient approaches, as\r\nit requires unnecessarily keeping up with and maintaining two separate sites.\r\nThe success of this particular method relies on the proper recognition of the\r\ndevice being used, and since new, cutting-edge yet unfamiliar technology is\r\nconstantly being released, redirects and errors are commonplace.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 3: Dynamic Serving</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With dynamic serving, the server will\r\nreconstruct the HTML code based on the type of device it determines is seeking\r\nto gain access to your site. As with Responsive Design, you will be able to use\r\nthe same URL as the desktop version of your site. Unlike Responsive Design,\r\nyour website content will not be a miniature version of the desktop site - it\r\nwill have it\'s own unique content that is specifically catered to a mobile\r\nuser.</p>\r\n<p>There are pros and cons to each of these\r\noptions, and it is essential to weigh the individual needs of your business\r\nbefore making a decision.

Choose the option\r\nthat works best for you.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 1: Responsive Design</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website featuring responsive design is a\r\npopular choice nowadays. With responsive design, your site content is\r\nessentially the same for the mobile and desktop version (same HTML). Depending\r\non the device that is being used, the layout will be tailored so that it is\r\ncomfortable to read and straightforward to navigate. Screen size and\r\norientation are both accounted for and your display will shrink or expand\r\naccordingly. With this option, all of the changes take place behind the scenes,\r\nand the user will always navigate to the same URL regardless of whether they\r\nare using a desktop computer, a smartphone or a tablet. Google prefers a\r\nwebsite with responsive design.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 2: Separate Mobile Website</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever visited a website on your phone\r\nbefore and noticed an automatic redirect to a URL with \" /mobile\", or\r\nsomething similar, following the web address? The businesses whose websites\r\ndisplay in this manner from a mobile-device have built a separate website\r\nspecifically for mobile users. When web browsing on-the-go was first gaining\r\npopularity, a separate mobile website is how most businesses handled the issue.\r\nNow, this method is considered to be one of the least efficient approaches, as\r\nit requires unnecessarily keeping up with and maintaining two separate sites.\r\nThe success of this particular method relies on the proper recognition of the\r\ndevice being used, and since new, cutting-edge yet unfamiliar technology is\r\nconstantly being released, redirects and errors are commonplace.</p>\r\n<p><b>Option 3: Dynamic Serving</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With dynamic serving, the server will\r\nreconstruct the HTML code based on the type of device it determines is seeking\r\nto gain access to your site.
